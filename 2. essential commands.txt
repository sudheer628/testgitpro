essential commands of github
----------------------------
origin
======
Git repositories will have just one remote, usually named origin.
it is used instead of that original repository's URL - and thereby makes referencing much easier.

Note that origin is by no means a "magical" name, but just a standard convention. Although it makes sense to leave this convention untouched, you could perfectly rename it without losing any functionality.

In the following example, the URL parameter to the "clone" command becomes the "origin" for the cloned local repository:

git clone https://github.com/gittower/git-crash-course.git

git push origin - by default pushes all your branches to the origin. While

git push origin master - pushing your master branch to the origin.


$ git remote show origin

Git FETCH PULL MERGE
====================

git pull command is meant to be a convenient shorthand for git fetch followed by git merge.

git pull origin master means run 'git fetch origin' first, then run 'git merge origin/master'.

commit, branch, tag, HEAD
=========================
Commit a state of the code base - is like taking a snapshot of that project

git commit -am ===> automatically stage the changes and commits - but it is dangerous.

git reset HEAD^ --soft (Save your changes, back to last commit)

git reset HEAD^ --hard (Discard changes, back to last commit)

Branch a reference to a commit; can have a tracked upstream
Tag a reference (standard) or an object (annotated)
HEAD a place where your working directory is now


ls-files & rm
=============

git ls-files ---> list the files
git rm ---> remove file from working directory & staging area.

mv
==

git mv file1.txt file2.txt --> rename the files

stash pop vs drop
=================
git stash pop removes the top stashed state and apply it on top of the current working tree. 
git stash drop just removes that state, not applying it.
