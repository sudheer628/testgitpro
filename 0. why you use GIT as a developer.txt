version control system ---> track history & work together
VCS ------> 1) centralized - subversion (if server goes offline, developers wont be able to access the code)
			2) distributed - GIT (each developer have their own copy of code locally)

GIT is free and open source.

=======================================================
No more copies, when you finish your work on a significant update for your application or a bug fix, you just need to “push” your project online to save it.


Delete and break your code; you just need to type a command to come back to the previous version and continue your work.

Work with your friends without sending an e-mail with the compressed project each time the code changes.

You can afford to forget what you did. A simple command is necessary to check your changes since the last time you saved your work.
